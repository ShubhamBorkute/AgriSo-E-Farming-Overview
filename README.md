# AgriSO E-farming 

The AgriSO E-farming project aims to revolutionize traditional farming practices by integrating Information Technology (IT) into farming operations. This involves the incorporation of diverse technologies to enhance operational efficiency, leading to sustainable agricultural practices. The project focuses on developing a web application that facilitates E-farming, which involves the electronic buying and selling of agricultural products.

# Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that connects farmers with consumers. The platform's purpose is to streamline and enhance the efficiency of agricultural transactions, fostering a more transparent and equitable food system. By leveraging technology, the AgriSO E-farming web application seeks to benefit both farmers and consumers.

# Key Features

Efficient Transactions: The web application provides a platform for farmers and consumers to engage in electronic transactions, simplifying the buying and selling of agricultural products.
Transparency: The platform ensures transparency in transactions, allowing both parties to have clear insights into the products, pricing, and terms involved.
Sustainability: The integration of IT into farming practices promotes sustainable agricultural methods, contributing to a more environmentally friendly and resilient food production system.

# How to Use

1) Registration: Farmers and consumers need to register on the platform to access its features.
2) Listing Products: Farmers can list their agricultural products, providing details such as quantity, pricing, and quality.
3) Browsing and Purchasing: Consumers can browse through the listed products, make informed decisions, and purchase directly from farmers.
